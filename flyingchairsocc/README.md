# FlyingChairsOcc dataset

<img src=demo_img.png>

The FlyingChairsOcc dataset is an extended version of the <a href="https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FlyingChairs.en.html" target="_blank">Flying Chairs Dataset</a>, including bi-directional optical flow ground truth and two occlusion maps for each image.
You may also find that another concurrent dataset, the <a href="https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FlyingChairs.en.html" target="_blank">Flying Chairs 2 Dataset</a>, is useful.

This dataset is made freely available to academic and non-academic entities for non-commercial purposes such as academic research, teaching, scientific publications, or personal experimentation. Permission is granted to use the data given that you agree:

1. That the dataset comes “AS IS”, without express or implied warranty. Although every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, we (TU Darmstadt) do not accept any responsibility for errors or omissions.
2. That you include a reference to the FlyingChairsOcc Dataset in any work that makes use of the dataset. For research papers, cite our publication: J. Hur and S. Roth, “Iterative residual refinement for joint optical flow and occlusion estimation,” in Proc. of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Long Beach, California, June 2019
3. That you do not distribute this dataset or modified versions. It is permissible to distribute derivative works in as far as they are abstract representations of this dataset (such as models trained on it or additional annotations that do not directly include any of our data) and do not allow to recover the dataset or something similar in character.
